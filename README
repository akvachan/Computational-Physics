                            Computational Physics Utilities
                                    Version 1.0, 2023
DESCRIPTION

This repository contains a collection of C++ utilities and functions
commonly used in computational physics. The main components include
functions for:

  * Numerical differentiation
  * Combinatorial calculations (e.g., binomial coefficients)
  * Unit conversions, such as converting decimal integers to binary
    representations

The code is organized into modular components with separate headers and
implementations for each functionality, ensuring clarity, reusability, and
maintainability.
